***What is Lexical Analysis?***
> In computer science, lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer,[1] or scanner, though scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. A lexer is generally combined with a parser, which together analyze the syntax of programming languages, web pages, and so forth. - Wikipedia([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis))

**How to Use**

Steps:

1. Add regular expressions in the form <Regular Expression Name> = <Definition>

Eg.: 

- R1 = (a+b)*(b+d)e*
- digit = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9

2. Set the order of regular expressions added using the (up and down)arrow buttons. The precedence is from top to bottom.

3. Write input in the input box and hit 'Tokenize" button.
